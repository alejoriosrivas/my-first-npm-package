# random-messages

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-msg

if you are a psicopath
npm i random-messages-platzi-npm-course@latest --save-dev
```

# Usage

```bash
Dont forget to use it on your Terminal
random-msg
```
